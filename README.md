1. Perhaps the most obvious observable trend is the overwhelming predominance of male 
players versus other genders. As such, males also make up the overwhelming majority
of purchases, although (perhaps based on their smaller sampling size) "other/non-disclosed"
spent the greatest average on game items, followed by females. One thing to consider
from this data is the combination of "other" genders and contributors who simply didn't
disclose -- while statistically small, any insights gleaned from the dataset will necessarily
be limited by this fact.

2. The great majority of players are under 30 years old, which means that, of course,
they also make up the great majority of purchasers. A look at the age analysis dataframe
also reveals that more purchases than players were made for players 19 and under. This
could suggest that each player has bought at least once, demonstrating a dedication
to the game from younger players.

3. Final Critic is Heroes of Pymoli's most popular and most profitable item, suggesting
that its higher price is not too big a dissuading factor for interested purchasers.
It could mean that as long as an item was seen as "worth it" by players, its price
was negotiable.
